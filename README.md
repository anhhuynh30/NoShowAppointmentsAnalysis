# NoShowAppointmentsProject
The aim of the project is to find the meaningful insights of the crucial factors that have strong impact on the patient's decisions on whether to present or absent for their medical appointments.

The dataset no_show_appointments_2016 includes information from 110 527 medical appointments in Brazil in 2016 with 14 associated variables (characteristics). With these characteristics, we can generate useful insights to predict if a patient will show up for their scheduled appointment, and also to understand the common reasons why the patients decided to not show up.

The followings are the details of 14 variables in the dataset [No-show Appointments](https://www.kaggle.com/joniarroba/noshowappointments):
